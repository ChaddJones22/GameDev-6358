    Dialogue: "I remember this locker room, that\u2019s my locker, and that\u2019s
      me reading the letter, the good news. Today was the day I found out that Rebecca
      got the operation and it was a success. I must have remembered it so easily
      because I already knew this outcome. This must mean this memory is fairly recent,
      it probably happened some time after Phase 1 of the testing began. When I look
      at myself it\u2019s definitely the case, I\u2019ve changed so much. I have
      a lot more muscle mass now and I\u2019m taller now, but that makes since thinking
      on what they had us doing. All they had us doing up to this point was trying
      to get us into what they called \u2018the perfect form\u2019. Every day we
      were working out and improving ourselves physically. They would rig us up to
      these machines to measure our progress and analyze our bodies, and with that
      intel they would construct strict individual training regiments to improve
      our physiques. To go along with the reshaping of our bodies they were enhancing
      our minds. In the evenings we would do various mental activities that they
      said would improve our mental functions. With all the various training everyone
      went through and the new drugs and treatments they were giving us it felt like
      everyone had reached the peak of what they were capable both physically and
      mentally. Which is why today was also the day that we began the second half
      of phase 1, when they started the \u201CAugmentation\u201D"

    Dialogue: Thank you for telling me the truth about my sister.

    Dialogue: "It was the most logical option to do. Without you receiving the information
      you wanted the continuation of the tests was unlikely at best. Lying to you
      would also make no sense. The information happened to be the desired outcome
      you wanted so informing you would only help, and even if it wasn\u2019t the
      outcome lying to you would only hinder future tests and possibly turn you hostile
      against us."

    speakerName: David
    Dialogue: "If you had lied to me without a doubt, I would have ceased performing
      these tests, and while I might have been angry, I doubt I would have become
      hostile. Plus, even if I was to become hostile it\u2019s not like I could be
      a threat. I know that after going through phase 1 of the research both physically
      and mentally I\u2019m at my peak and that makes me very capable, but against
      any security measures you have in place I would achieve nothing."

    Dialogue: While yes most likely you would not be able to actually harm us in
      any way physically, and the possibilities of you being able to harm us and/or
      the company in other ways is even less likely we must prepare for everything.

    Dialogue: "It\u2019s also why we did not wish to inform you of anything before
      you had learned it yourself. Should it have put a heavy enough strain on your
      mental capacities or corrupt your memories there is no telling what could happen
      to you or what you might do."

    Dialogue: "I see, I\u2019m sorry for doing what I did but I needed to know."

    Dialogue: We understand, and luckily there was no noticeable negative outcome
      from it so far. It also appears that your memories are almost fully restored
      and appear to be all intact.
  - speakerID: 0
    speakerName: David
    Dialogue: Yeah. On the topic of memories, I was curious as to why when they are
      restored, I view them from an outside perspective looking in instead of from
      the perspective of myself in the memory.

    Dialogue: "A difficult question to answer. Why we don\u2019t know the absolute
      reason as to why it is perceived that way, we do have 1 very likely theory.
      However, telling you this theory is something we cannot do."

    speakerName: David
    Dialogue: "Why? Wouldn\u2019t informing me on how these things work help me better
      understand and possibly recover my memories?"
  - speakerID: 3
    speakerName: 
    Dialogue: That is unlikely.
  - speakerID: 1
    speakerName: 
    Dialogue: To appease your growing curiosity we will give you a very simplified
      version of the theory. We believe that due to the training you went through
      for both your body and mind as well as the augmentations have altered how your
      brain and memory function. As such it is harder to see the memory from the
      perspective of who you were since you are so different know. Plus, with your
      damaged memory and improved mental capacity you may subconsciously trying to
      create/remember these memories in the form of an outsider where you have more
      information.

    speakerName: David
    Dialogue: "So, because I\u2019m so different from who I was before its harder
      for me to see my memories from my old self\u2019s perspective. And with my
      mind being enhanced I am better replicating the memory in a form where it is
      easier to understand. Is that correct?"
  - speakerID: 1
    speakerName: 
    Dialogue: In summary yes.
  - speakerID: 0
    speakerName: David
    Dialogue: "Okay then. With where I\u2019m at now I feel more comfortable continuing.
      I also feel like I\u2019m so close to recovering everything soon."
  - speakerID: 1
    speakerName: 
    Dialogue: That is useful information to know. We should continue then but we
      must be cautious.
