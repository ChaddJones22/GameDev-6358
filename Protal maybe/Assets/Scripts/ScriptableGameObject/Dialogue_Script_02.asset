    Dialogue: "I\u2019m remembering something again, hopefully it\u2019s more than
      a few years of my childhood and I learn more of who I am. Wait, what is this?
      I\u2019m just sitting there watching TV, what kind of memory is this it tells
      me nothing. Well at least I can see what I look like and damn am I a strapping
      young man, with a face like that I could have easily become a model, I wonder
      why I didn\u2019t? I seem really engaged in the TV I wonder what I\u2019m watching?
      The news? Why would I be so\u2026 I remember at this time a company less than
      a decade old was making huge waves in the technology industry, they were completely
      re-inventing how the world functioned. No wonder I\u2019m so engaged they\u2019re
      also mentioning a new device they just released, since its coming from a company
      that\u2019s changing the world anyone would want to know. What\u2019s that
      I\u2019m holding? Is that my report card? Holy smokes I\u2019m good looking
      and super intelligent I\u2019m a real catch. With grades like that I could
      probably achieve whatever goal I wanted for myse... I see now, this explains
      why I didn\u2019t become a model I had a much bigger goal. It looks like the
      news clip is about to end and so is the memory. While I did learn more about
      myself it wasn\u2019t much, hopefully I\u2019ll learn more next time. \u201CProvidence
      Technology\u201D. What?"

      not responding."

    speakerName: David
    Dialogue: "I\u2019m here, sorry I was remembering more of my past. And before
      you ask, no I didn\u2019t remember everything just a portion again."

    speakerName: Scientist 2
    Dialogue: Anything useful this time or more fluff that serves no purpose?
  - speakerID: 0
    speakerName: David
    Dialogue: Everything serves a purpose in some form for someone so while it may
      seem useless too you me remembering my past is very important and useful to
      me, I figured someone as smart as you would know that but I guess not.
  - speakerID: 3
    speakerName: Scientist 3
    Dialogue: What did you remember?
  - speakerID: 0
    speakerName: David
    Dialogue: I saw a scene from when I was in high school and I remember a lot of
      what happened from my childhood up till then.
  - speakerID: 1
    speakerName: Scientist 1
    Dialogue: "You saw a scene? The memories don\u2019t just flood back to you all
      at once? How do you remember everything and what exactly do you see?"
  - speakerID: 0
    speakerName: David
    Dialogue: Slow down buddy you seem like your about to bust out of your seat there

    speakerName: Scientist 1
    Dialogue: I apologize I lost myself in my excitement. Would you be able to answer
      my questions?
  - speakerID: 0
    speakerName: David
    Dialogue: "Sure, no problem. When I regain my memories, I see a scene, a memory
      from my past and I observe from an outside perspective. The memory doesn\u2019t
      last long and once it ends, I wake up and then I remember a whole bunch of
      other stuff up too that memory and a little bit after."
  - speakerID: 3
    speakerName: Scientist 3
    Dialogue: So, would you say that you experience a memory from an out of body
      experience and once it concludes other memories up to that point come back
      to you and you even see a few memories beyond that main one?
  - speakerID: 0
    speakerName: David
    Dialogue: That sounds about right.
  - speakerID: 3
    speakerName: Scientist 3
    Dialogue: I wonder why only one memory and why do you see that specific memory,
      could you tell us about this memory?
  - speakerID: 0
    speakerName: David
    Dialogue: "There isn\u2019t much to tell I learned more about myself, specifically
      what my dream was."
  - speakerID: 2
    speakerName: Scientist 2
    Dialogue: "Since it\u2019s your dream I\u2019m absolutely positive it must be
      something grand. What is your \u2018dream\u2019 then?"
  - speakerID: 0
    speakerName: David
    Dialogue: "\u2026 It actually is quite grand I wanted to work for a company that
      was changing the world Providence Technology as a lead scientist."
  - speakerID: 3
    speakerName: Scientist 3
    Dialogue: "\u2026 What a pleasant dream."
  - speakerID: 0
    speakerName: David
    Dialogue: "Thanks, but we should probably continue on I\u2019d like to learn
      more. Is there anything I need to know for the next test?"
  - speakerID: 3
    speakerName: Scientist 3
    Dialogue: Yes, in the next test you will be getting a new weapon a shotgun with
      a unique feature in its kick. With this shotgun you are able to propel yourself
      in any direction you could use it to jump higher, farther, or fall faster.
  - speakerID: 0
    speakerName: David
    Dialogue: So, this shotgun basically allows me to rocket... or I guess shotgun
      jump then? What kind of videogame type nonsense are you guys making?
  - speakerID: 2
    speakerName: Scientist 2
    Dialogue: " If you want to see it in such a simple manner then yes it allows
      you to \u201CShotgun Jump\u201D"
  - speakerID: 0
    speakerName: David
    Dialogue: Cool, I guess. My guess is I use and interact with it the same way
      as the pistol?
  - speakerID: 3
    speakerName: Scientist 3
    Dialogue: "That is correct but you would press the key \u20182\u2019 instead
      for the second slot and on the topic of your pistol it has been taken away."
  - speakerID: 0
    speakerName: David
    Dialogue: What? Why? And as a matter of fact, how?
  - speakerID: 1
    speakerName: Scientist 1
    Dialogue: We took you pistol away because we want you to go into each level with
      nothing so we can have the purest results. And all tools/weapons picked up
      through the test are taken away automatically when you enter this room.
  - speakerID: 0
    speakerName: David
    Dialogue: "Good to know, I guess I\u2019m off then for the next test. Let\u2019s
      a go"
