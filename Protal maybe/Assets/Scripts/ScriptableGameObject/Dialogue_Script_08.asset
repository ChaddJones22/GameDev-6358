    Dialogue: "I remember, I remember everything now, I know the truth now. I know
      what this operation room was for. This is where they would augment us. They
      would put those metal contraptions in us, those machines. I can still feel
      the excruciating pain of having bits and pieces of me being replaced with metal.
      They changed who\u2026 no, what we were, at this point we were no longer humans
      too much of us had become metal. The scars that are left on my body will always
      be a constant reminder for what they did to me. I will always feel the pain,
      but it is nothing compared to the mental anguish they put us through. Day after
      day after day they would put us in these situations, no those were nightmares.
      They had us go through countless traumas, horrific event, mind numbing choices.
      They were trying to break us mentally. They wanted to erase who we were by
      making us forget all for the final augmentation. Which brings us to the here
      and now. This operating room, ne restrained to the table and that device on
      my head. They brought us all the way to this point just so they could achieve
      their results. For them there was no to far. That\u2019s why they were so willing
      to augment our minds. Its why they put that machine in my head. And they knew,
      they knew what would happen. They weren\u2019t surprised when I lost my memories,
      they knew it would happen. That also explains why people would disappear throughout
      phase 1. They would have their memories removed so there was no way they could
      be re-introduced to everyone else, we would all know something was wrong. And
      finally, it was my turn, so they put me through the operation, they caused
      me to lose my memories, they were the cause of all the pain. \u201CThose Three\u201D."

    Dialogue: "\u2026 You knew. You all knew I would lose my memories. How could
      you all do this, where is your humanity? What did you all gain to justify what
      you did to us? You all lied to us, lied to me. How do I even know that the
      letter I got saying my sister recovered is true? I swear ill make you all pay.
      You all destroyed who I was, were the cause of my memory loss but pretended
      like you didn\u2019t know, like you wanted to help me recover my memories.
      What was the purpose of all that fake concern you showed me at the beginning
      Doctor Sarah? Its clear that none of you actually cared about any of us or
      our well being so why? What was the point of arguing with me and getting on
      my nerves Doctor Steven, what do you gain by risking my cooperation? Was it
      all just a ploy to make me feel more safe and secure around you all, so I would
      trust you? Well, congrats it worked, but not anymore. And you Doctor John are
      the root cause of all of this, the head scientist in charge of everything.
      Did you enjoy creating these experiments to destroy who we were? I hope you
      all had fun with these so-called tests because I\u2019m coming for you all
      and you will pay."
