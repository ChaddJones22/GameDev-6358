    Dialogue: "Please let me know what happens next. Tell me she\u2019s okay. I need
      to know how she is. What? Where is this? And who is that man sitting across
      from me. He just handed me a piece of paper what\u2019s on it? It mentions
      a research study, and something about being a test subject, it also says the
      tests will be conducted by\u2026 Providence Technology? I wanted to work there
      but that was as a researcher not as a research subject. Why am I being offered
      a position as a test subject, and why the hell am I signing it so quickly?
      There\u2019s no way I could have read through the contract so quickly. Speaking
      of reading through the contract there is a bunch of shady stuff that would
      make any sane person flat out reject the offer. With that being the case why
      would I sign it soooooo wholly smokes that\u2019s a shit ton of cash. I needed
      the money for the operations, after the accident the doctors said she would
      need multiple operations and we didn\u2019t have enough money. No wonder I
      would sign such a shady contract I needed that money more than anything. I
      swore that I would protect her, and I would do anything to keep her safe. Even
      if that means \u201CMaking A Deal With The Devil\u201D."

      Technology so why didn\u2019t you tell me that you were them?"

    Dialogue: Revealing Information to you in that manner could have resulted in
      a mental shock that could have resulted in serious damage so we decided that
      the best course of action was to let you remember on your own. Can you tell
      us what you do remember?

    speakerName: David
    Dialogue: "\u2026 Yeah. I remember everything up to the point of me signing the
      contract that I would participate in this research study so my sister could
      get the money needed to have the operation. Speaking of that how is my sister?
      Did she get the money? Was she able to receive the operation?"

    Dialogue: As we said earlier informing you of things that you will/should come
      to remember before you actually do could have some serious conseq-

      on some of your most recent memories, we recommend you continue the tests until-

    Dialogue: "Don\u2019t worry I\u2019m still going to finish the tests. I signed
      that contract and since you all upheld yours, I will uphold mine. Plus, I still
      want the rest of my memories."
