    Dialogue: "What is this place, whose room is this? I don\u2019t recognize it\u2026
      or do I? I don\u2019t remember this room but it feels so familiar, almost like
      a home away from home. Where am I, or I guess past me? That must be me sitting
      on the bed, but I look older. I see know I must be away at college and this
      is my current dorm room, a home while at school, my home away from home. I
      look so concerned and unsure about something, could I be nervous about a class?
      I don\u2019t see any school work around me and the TV is on so I doubt its
      that. The TV is just playing a movie but I doubt that is enough to make me
      look so concerned so what is it? My phone is open to a news article, maybe
      what\u2019s concerning me is in there. Plus 1 to detection skills as well as
      too depression, turns out there has been a scandal at my dream job of Providence
      Technology. Apparently, there has been a lot of shady business practices as
      well as some issues regarding some of their scientific procedures. There\u2019s
      a surprising number of humanitarian issues. No wonder I\u2019m so concerned
      my future looks very murky since my dreams are now crumbling around me. But
      not all hope is lost, in a few days\u2019 news will drop that the company will
      have tighter government supervision and will be coming under \u201CNew Management\u201D"

    Dialogue: Apologies, since we figured you would reclaim a portion of your memories
      we decided to wait until you woke up before we have any discussions and we
      were caught off guard by your comment just now.
  - speakerID: 0
    speakerName: David
    Dialogue: I see, my comment there without any context would definitely confuse
      some people. In the memory a few years had passed and I was in college and
      news had just broke that the company I wanted to work for Providence Technology
      was going through a massive scandal.

    Dialogue: "Yeah\u2026 at first, I was but I remembered that in a few days\u2019
      news would drop saying the company would be coming under new management so
      not all hope was lost."

    speakerName: David
    Dialogue: "Yeah, I\u2019m fine I was just caught off guard by the comment made
      by your associate I normally but heads with. While the comment wasn\u2019t
      a very nice, I would even say rude way of putting things it didn\u2019t feel
      malicious so I was caught off guard."

    Dialogue: You said something that caught my attention earlier, you mentioned
      remembering something that would happen in the future during your memory. Is
      this the first time this has happened?
  - speakerID: 0
    speakerName: David
    Dialogue: Now that you mention it yeah it is. I generally get other memories
      once the main one completes and some of them are even of thing that will happen
      a little bit into the future but I have never remembered anything or any other
      memories during the main one.

    Dialogue: "I mean I don\u2019t think it is all that interesting or concerning
      I would have remembered it once I came too most likely"

    speakerName: Scientist 1
    Dialogue: For you perhaps this is a good thing but for us this is quite concerning.

    speakerName: David
    Dialogue: Why would it be concerning?

    Dialogue: Any changes in how things were going could be a bad sign.

    Dialogue: Plus, now that memories are overlapping one another and combining the
      future with the past this could alter your state of mind even if slightly.

    Dialogue: Yeah that could be bad should we stop?
  - speakerID: 3
    speakerName: Scientist 3
    Dialogue: "I don\u2019t think there will be a need for that we will monitor your
      condition and should something serious should happen we will take the appropriate
      actions."

    Dialogue: For the next test pressure plates or buttons will be introduced. Upon
      a certain amount of weight being placed on them they will trigger some contraption
      to move which will allow you to progress throughout the test. Are you ready
      to proceed?
