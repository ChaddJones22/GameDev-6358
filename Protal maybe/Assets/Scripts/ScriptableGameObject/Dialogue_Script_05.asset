      I\u2019m scared, am I going to die? No. No, no, no this is a memory so I couldn\u2019t
      have died. Then am I in danger? Am I drowning? I don\u2019t see any water;
      in fact, this looks like the apartment I rented out when I started grad school.
      I can\u2019t breathe and since I\u2019m not drowning, am I chocking? No, I
      don\u2019t appear to be chocking, I\u2019m just standing there on a phone call,
      so what\u2019s wron- AAAAAAAAAGGGHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!! It hurts. It hurts, it hurts
      it hurts. My heart it hurts so much, it feels like its about to explode. The
      pain, it feels like my heart is on fire it feels like its about to burst. Please
      someone anybody help me, the pain is so excruciating, please just make it stop\u2026
      Stop? It stopped; my heart stopped. Why is my heart stopped why is my heart
      not beating? A moment ago, it felt like my heart was on fire but now it\u2019s
      so cold. What\u2019s happening? What is this\u2026 No, oh God please no, please

    Dialogue: "His memories are coming closer and closer to the present. Do you think
      that he\u2026?"
  - speakerID: 1
    speakerName: 
    Dialogue: "It\u2019s unlikely. His memories seem to be key moments in his life
      that dictate who he is and what he does in the future. He still should have
      plenty of moments like that in his life before that point. Based on the previous
      memory the most likely cause was that he recalled \u201CThe Accident\u201D
      and is in a state of emotional shock."

    Dialogue: Should we postpone the remaining tests until he stabilizes?
  - speakerID: 3
    speakerName: 
    Dialogue: "You must be joking we are getting the best results we have ever gotten
      and this is the key point in the tests where he needs to act now. There\u2019s
      absolutely no way we can put this on pause."
  - speakerID: 2
    speakerName: 
    Dialogue: Yes, but his current emotional state could cause the results of the
      tests to be a complete mess and there is no telling what the back lash could
      be.
  - speakerID: 1
    speakerName: 
    Dialogue: You both make valid points. He had a similar episode earlier and choose
      to continue right away but this could be worse. Perhaps we should ask the patient
      how he is doing and what he thinks?
  - speakerID: 3
    speakerName: 
    Dialogue: Then we shall do that.

  - speakerID: 0
    speakerName: David
    Dialogue: "No! No, I can continue. In fact, I feel like if I was to stop now,
      I wouldn\u2019t be able to continue again so I need to continue now."

    Dialogue: What do I need to know for the next test?
  - speakerID: 1
    speakerName: 
    Dialogue: You already know everything you need to know. All the remaining test
      will require you to use the knowledge you acquired from the previous ones.
  - speakerID: 0
    speakerName: David
    Dialogue: So, for the remaining tests there is nothing else new I need to know?
  - speakerID: 1
    speakerName: 
    Dialogue: That is correct.
  - speakerID: 0
    speakerName: David
    Dialogue: "Good, then that means we can get through the remaining test that much
      faster. Let\u2019s not delay."

    Dialogue: Perfect.
