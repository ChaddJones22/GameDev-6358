    Dialogue: "I\u2019m seeing something\u2026 an image of some sort? No, not an
      image, but a scene, something from a movie maybe. I see an adult and a child,
      they\u2019re outside a few yards away from some building. The man is talking
      to the young boy, the man seems serious but he can\u2019t stop smiling and
      the young boy doesn\u2019t seem to be listening all that much, he\u2019s so
      excited to the point where he\u2019s not paying attention. Wait why do I know
      that they are a man and a young boy? They stopped talking, they\u2019re looking
      towards the building, something no, someone is coming out. It\u2019s a woman
      and a young girl a little older than the boy, they\u2019re exiting the house
      together and the woman is holding something, some rags? I don\u2019t know why
      but the little girl really wants those blankets for some reason. No wait, it\u2019s
      not the blanket she wants its what they\u2019re wrapped around, a new born
      baby, a beautiful baby girl. I see they\u2019re a family and this isn\u2019t
      some scene from a movie it\u2019s a memory from my childhood. Wait it looks
      like my dad is about to say something. His mouth is moving but I can\u2019t
      hear he\u2019s saying. I just heard him say something but what? He said a name
      but who\u2019s? What was the name I can almost hear it, c\u2019mon, I almost
      have it. \u201CDavid\u201D"

    Dialogue: Why are you telling me key binds and how will they help me use this
      gun?
  - speakerID: 1
    speakerName: Scientist 1
    Dialogue: You have been equipped with a belt that is linked to your brain and
      can be used as a storage device. Most likely since you forgot how to use it
      with your lost memories, we figured the best way to have you relearn to use
      it was to associate it with something familiar like videogame controls. This
      handgun will let you move and destroy objects that block your path. Do you
      understand?
