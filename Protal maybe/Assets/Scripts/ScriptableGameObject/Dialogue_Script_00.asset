    speakerName: Scientist 3
    Dialogue: What about your memories, can you recall any of those? Specifically,

    speakerName: ???
    Dialogue: "When I tried to recall some memories from my childhood it felt like
      my head was being split open with a knife. I remember seeing some symbols of
      some kind, I think some were numbers but I couldn\u2019t tell because the pain
      came right then."

    Dialogue: How peculiar
  - speakerID: 3
    speakerName: Scientist 3
    Dialogue: "XXXX this has never happened before or at least not to this degree.
      We have had instances of there being some issues, even some where people have
      formed gaps in their memory but they didn\u2019t lose it entirely. What should
      we do?"
  - speakerID: 0
    speakerName: ???
    Dialogue: (XXXX I know she was calling him by name but why did it sound like
      gibberish)
  - speakerID: 2
    speakerName: Scientist 2
    Dialogue: "What do you mean \u2018what should we do?\u2019? Its obvious that
      we continue at full force. Although his personality leaves much to be desired,
      the fact that he is a blank slate right now means that we could achieve tremendous
      results from the experiments with absolute 0 internal interference. He just
      might be the key we need to finish this. Why would you even ask XXXX that question
      XXXXX, if you are- "
  - speakerID: 1
    speakerName: Scientist 1
    Dialogue: "XXXXXX. That\u2019s enough, I don\u2019t believe that XXXXX was having
      any doubts I think she was just curious on how we should and are going to proceed
      given this unfamiliar circumstance"
  - speakerID: 2
    speakerName: Scientist 2
    Dialogue: I apologize XXXX I got heated given the situation and spoke rashly.
      I guess I also owe you an apology as well XXXXX
  - speakerID: 0
    speakerName: ???
    Dialogue: "What a 10 out of 10 apology right there, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve
      ever heard a more sincere apology, brings me to tears."
  - speakerID: 2
    speakerName: Scientist 2
    Dialogue: Scratch what I said before he is absolutely intolerable just stop the
      experiments now and kick him out. It will save us time and sanity.
  - speakerID: 1
    speakerName: Scientist 1
    Dialogue: "XXXXXX calm down, you\u2019re letting him bait you too easily. We
      will continue with the experiment\u2026 variation XS10S"
  - speakerID: 3
    speakerName: Scientist 3
    Dialogue: Are you sure that now, with him, is the most appropriate time to do
      this XXXX?
  - speakerID: 1
    speakerName: Scientist 1
    Dialogue: "Yes, I\u2019m absolutely positive that now is the time to do this
      variation"

    speakerName: ???
    Dialogue: I hate to be so rude and interrupt the conversation that you all are
      clearly having about me so politely in front of me but I would very much like
      to be included in that conversation.
  - speakerID: 1
    speakerName: Scientist 1
    Dialogue: "Yes, Mr\u2026  Patient 8574219 how are you feeling right now?"
  - speakerID: 0
    speakerName: Patient 8574219
    Dialogue: "(Really, you\u2019re not going to even tell me my name\u2026 I might
      as well not ask because they probably won\u2019t tell me either way) *sigh*
      Surprisingly I feel really good besides the pain I felt earlier. All my senses
      feel sharper and my body feels more responsive. It feels like this body isn\u2019t
      the one I should have but the body that is meant for me it feels weird but
      not in a bad way."
  - speakerID: 1
    speakerName: Scientist 1
    Dialogue: "Good it seems that there are no other issues from the initial treatments.
      Since that is the case, I will explain what\u2019s happening to you. You initially
      signed up for our experiment in which we try to improve the capabilities of
      a human being in all capacities. From the initial stage we were able to find
      a formula that allowed us to alter the state of a person\u2019s body and increase
      many of its features resulting in sharper senses and a body that feels more
      natural. However, there are some issues these alterations tend to cause one
      of which being the loss of memories."
  - speakerID: 0
    speakerName: Patient 8574219
    Dialogue: "So, it\u2019s because I took part in those alterations, I lost my
      memories."
  - speakerID: 1
    speakerName: Scientist 1
    Dialogue: Indeed, however once we found out there were side effects, we began
      looking for ways to reverse the adverse effects. We found out that the best
      way to reverse the negative effects would be to have the patient complete certain
      tasks that tested their mind and put their new found physical abilities to
      use.
  - speakerID: 3
    speakerName: Scientist 3
    Dialogue: This was fortunate for us because that was most of what the second
      phase of the experiment is focused on is having the patient complete various
      tasks to increase their mental capacity and develop a more advanced brain.
  - speakerID: 0
    speakerName: Patient 8574219
    Dialogue: So basically, as long as I complete the trials for the second phase
      my memories should return?
  - speakerID: 2
    speakerName: Scientist 2
    Dialogue: Yes, as long as you do what we say and complete the tasks we assign
      to you like a good little boy you will be able to regain your memories, how
      fortunate for you. But more importantly the data and information we will gather
      from you will be most useful for us which is fortunate for us and all of mankind.
  - speakerID: 0
    speakerName: Patient 8574219
    Dialogue: "If it means ruining your day, I might just forgo my memories. But
      how fortunate for you I really want my memories back. Based on your conversation
      it\u2019s clear that I provide you all with a very unique and special situation,
      what makes me so special."
  - speakerID: 1
    speakerName: Scientist 1
    Dialogue: Based off of past result people who have lost portions of their memory
      tend to give us the best results and push us one step closer to completing
      phase 2.
  - speakerID: 3
    speakerName: Scientist 3
    Dialogue: We believe that since you have fully lost your memories that the results,
      we can get from your trials will be enough for us to complete phase 2 and move
      to phase 3.
  - speakerID: 0
    speakerName: Patient 8574219
    Dialogue: "So, I\u2019m the missing puzzle piece you all need to reach your solution?"
  - speakerID: 3
    speakerName: Scientist 3
    Dialogue: Precisely
  - speakerID: 0
    speakerName: Patient 8574219
    Dialogue: "If it means getting my memories back let\u2019s do this. Leroy Jenkins"

    Dialogue: Mama Mia

    speakerName: Patient 8574219
    Dialogue: Here we go again
