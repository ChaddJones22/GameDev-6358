    Dialogue: "This feels wrong. I know this is a memory and that it will show me
      more of who I am but for some reason I don\u2019t want to remember it. Although
      I feel this way, I need to know who I am so I have to see this. Talk about
      setting the mood, this rain really makes everything even more depressing. I
      see mom and dad by the front door but they seem really awkward, they have such
      a good relationship what\u2019s up with that? Oh, there\u2019s Isabella, she
      must be back from college, but why is she handing dad a suitcase? She\u2019s
      saying goodbye so dad must be going on a business trip but why is she so sad
      about it he\u2019ll be back eventually. I can hear Rebecca crying, isn\u2019t
      she a bit old to be crying from dad going on a business trip I mean she\u2019s
      already in middle school. Dad\u2019s looking my way but why is he giving me
      a weak smile? Why do I look so uncomfortable, why aren\u2019t I saying anything
      doing anything? I should at least go over to say goodbye and that I can\u2019t
      wait for him to come back home. Home, now I remember why everyone is so sad
      and I know hats coming next, moms going to apologize. That\u2019s not what
      I want to hear I don\u2019t want to hear her say she\u2019s sorry, I want her
      to not get the \u201CDivorce\u201D"

    Dialogue: Well, this is just great I guess this will happen every time he completes
      a test. This is just slowing us down.

    speakerName: David
    Dialogue: Well good morning to you too.
  - speakerID: 3
    speakerName: Scientist 3
    Dialogue: Welcome back David. I guess this means that we can assume our hypothesis
      to be true for the time being.
  - speakerID: 1
    speakerName: Scientist 1
    Dialogue: "There isn\u2019t a lot of evidence to guarantee it but there is enough
      were we should assume it to be true."

    speakerName: David
    Dialogue: What hypothesis are you all talking about?
  - speakerID: 2
    speakerName: Scientist 2
    Dialogue: The annoying one where every time you complete a test you regain a
      portion of your memories which takes a good 12 hours slowing us down.
  - speakerID: 0
    speakerName: David
    Dialogue: "It takes 12 hours? No wonder I don\u2019t feel the need to sleep I\u2019m
      resting for that long. I guess my other necessities are also taken care of
      during that time since I don\u2019t feel the need to eat or drink either."

    speakerName: Scientist 2
    Dialogue: "Yes, that is the case and I\u2019m also quite happy to see you learned
      to finally behave properly-"
  - speakerID: 0
    speakerName: David
    Dialogue: "Would it kill you to not make a smart comment every time you open
      your mouth? The reason I, as you would say, \u2018behaved properly\u2019 is
      because of the memory I experienced."
  - speakerID: 2
    speakerName: Scientist 2
    Dialogue: And what just so happens to be this memory that did me a favor?
  - speakerID: 0
    speakerName: David
    Dialogue: "It was about a month before my high school graduation when my parents\u2019
      divorce officially went through and my dad moved out."

    Dialogue: "I\u2026 see. That sounds painful"
  - speakerID: 0
    speakerName: David
    Dialogue: Yeah so can we just move on to the next test?
  - speakerID: 3
    speakerName: Scientist 3
    Dialogue: Perhaps you should take a break and come to terms with your memories
      and wait till your in a better head space?
  - speakerID: 0
    speakerName: David
    Dialogue: Thanks, but no thanks. Getting back into the tests as soon as possible
      to give me something to do is probably for the best.

    Dialogue: "I don\u2019t think this is wise the \u2013"

    Dialogue: But the results -

    speakerName: Scientist 1
    Dialogue: The decision has been made we continue on.

    speakerName: David
    Dialogue: What do I need to know?

    speakerName: Scientist 2
    Dialogue: "For the next test you will be getting another new weapon, this time
      an assault rifle. This tool allows for a consistent application of force which
      allows for the moving of heavier blocks. To use it you will have to press the
      key \u20183\u2019 once you have picked it up."
  - speakerID: 0
    speakerName: David
    Dialogue: "Alright then. See you once it\u2019s done."
